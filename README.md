# Personal Portfolio
This is The Portfolio from the minor Applied Data Science of Levy Duivenvoorden (18005152).<br/>
Team members: Niels (Nelis), Niels, Amin en Jefry.<br/>

# Project definition
We are team Zero and we work with our problem owner, mr. Rahola (He was also the problem owner of Brian).<br/>
The task that was given is to see if it is possible to predict the electricity production and consumption one day in advance on hourly resolution.<br/>
## onderzoeksvraag
The more specific research question is:<br/>
What is a suitable machine learning model to predict energy use & production of a “zero at the meter” residential house, one day in advance with (if possible) an hourly resolution?<br/>
## literature review
We did an individual literature study in the first weeks, and afterwards we came together and concluded which were the best.<br/>
We all delivered 3 papers with high potential. After which we all red the best papers. The papers were ranked in excel: <br/>
![LiteratureStudyAllSources](literaturePapersWeek5.xlsx)
After this we found some papers, however we found out that there aren't many papers that looks like our research.<br/>
Around week 10 we concluded that more literature was needed to find the best model to make.<br/>
I found three papers that had interesting results:<br/>
- a
- b
- c
### Data preprocessing
How was the data being processed?<br/>
### chosen models
According to the literature review the following models were chosen.<br/>
The configuration of this model was:<br/>
The model was trained.<br/>
The model was evaluated.<br/>
The outcome was visualized.<br/>

## conclusion
The conclusion is...

# written code (notebooks)
The code that has been written will be here.
Only the general purpose of the notebook.
## DataCamp exercizes
Below are the mendatory DataCamp Courses:¬

¬

The Extra DataCamp courses me (and the other Teammembers) did:
- Time Series Analysis in Python
- Visualizing Time Series Data in Python
- Manipulating Time Series Data in Python
- ARIMA Models in Python
- Machine Learning for Time Series Data in Python
## learned functions
All the learned methods in data science will be here.
With respect to the written code.

# Group effort
## Feature selection
What features were selected?<br/>
## General overview
The general plan will be stated here.<br/>
### planning
Every week we came together to make an sprint planning for the next week.<br/>
## presentations
Which presentations did I give?<br/>
## reflections
What did I learn this minor...<br/>

# Terminalogical (complex jargon)

END THINGS TO DO:<br/>
- check links.<br/>
- Make as short and specific as possible.<br/>
- check if the big picture is clear.<br/>
- Relation between the lectures and presentations and the problem.<br/>
- clear contribution per team member of each notebooks.<br/>
